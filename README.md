# Primal-Dual-Algorithm
# Overview
The Primal-Dual Algorithm is an optimization algorithm commonly used to solve linear programming and convex optimization problems. It is based on the concept of duality in optimization, which provides alternative ways to formulate and solve optimization problems.  
# Requirements
